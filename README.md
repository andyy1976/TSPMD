# Build

To build TSPMD by yourself you need Visual Studio [15.6.7](https://aka.ms/eac464). In the last version of Visual Studio there is a bug which does not handle the submission of the download process correctly and thus the downloaded files are broken. You can follow the issue [here](https://github.com/mono/mono/issues/9808).
