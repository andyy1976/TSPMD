# The Simple Pocket Media Downloader

The Simple Pocket Media Downloader aka. **TSPMD** is an audio and video downloader app for android. It supports various tubes.

# How to use?

Select the tube from the drop-down list and enter either the artist, the title or the album name in the search box. After clicking on the search button you will see the relevant results.

The app includes a lightweight audio and video player. It is designed only for previewing the media files. Please use a full-fledged media player like [VLC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.videolan.vlc) for playing.

The files are downloaded to the **download folder** on your android device.

# Build

To build TSPMD by yourself you need Visual Studio [15.6.7](https://aka.ms/eac464). In the last version of Visual Studio there is a bug which does not handle the submission of the download process correctly and thus the downloaded files are broken. You can follow the issue [here](https://github.com/mono/mono/issues/9808).
